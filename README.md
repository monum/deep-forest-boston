# deep-forest-boston

This is a repository to track development of a new model for DeepForest, a Python package for predicting tree crowns. Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/monum/deep-forest-boston/wiki) to get a better understanding how we implemeneted Boston Specific DeepForest model by training it over Local data to get better predictions. 

The ideal outcome of this project is:

1) The creation of a new, accurate machine learning model focused on urban tree canopies
 
2) The creation of a simple web interface for the Parks Department to upload new aerial imagery for analysis

3) The ability for the Parks Department of Boston to generate a list of statistics on tree counts to ensure that it continues to plants trees in an equitable manner across the city.
